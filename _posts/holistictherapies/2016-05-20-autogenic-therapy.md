Autogenic Therapy is an easily learned self-calming technique taught either individually or in groups, over 8-10 weeks. When practiced, it allows you to switch off the body’s ‘fight or flight’ stress system and switch on the relaxation response of ‘rest, repair and recuperate’, at will. It helps you to stop reacting automatically to stress and gives you back control.
